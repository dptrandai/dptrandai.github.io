        <p>My name is Dustin Trandai. I was born in Indiana, but grew up in Austin, T.X. I attended the University of Texas at Austin and graduated with a Bacherlors in Economics. After school I moved to Dallas to start my professional career. 
                After working in sales for 2 years, I have decided to make a career change. I wanted to have a career that involved more critical thinking and team interactivity. I have always grown up being around a team environment. I used to play all types of team sports like soccer, basketball, and football. I cant wait to see what this bootcamp has to offer!
