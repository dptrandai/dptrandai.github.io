        <p>Hi my name is Dustin Trandai. I have graduated from The University of Texas at Austin with a Bachelors in Economics. After graduating I moved to Dallas and started my career in the Personal Finance industry. 
            I decided to change career paths as I wanted my work to involve critical thinking and problem solving. Coding has been fun and I can't wait to see what this course has next.
